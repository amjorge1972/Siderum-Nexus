# Electronics

Electronics are very simple. The microcontroller is the brain. Drivers are the connection between microcontroller and steppers. And the steppers do the mecanical job. 

The ESP32 MCU (Micro Controller Unit) was chosen because of its capabilities:
- 240MHZ 32 bit dual core processor
- 448kB ROM / 520kB RAM
- 4MB storage
- Native Bluetooth, Wi Fi, PWM, Serial Comm
- 38 pin Dev Board
- popular and affordable

The stepper drivers are a very usual in 3D printers universe. This circuit board can operate with TMC2208, DRV8825, A4908 and any other with the same pinout.
A4808 are the oldest model, louder operation, 16 microsteps per step and medium current.
DRV8825 have a better current capacity, louder operation and 32 microsteps per step.
TMC2208 are very quiet, medium current and 16 microsteps per step. And could reach 256 microsteps per step using software config. But a bit more expensive.

The power supply must be 12 Volts 5 Amps. A L7809CV Voltage Regulator provides 5 Volts 1 Amp power to MCU and drives.

When continous energized, stepper motors can reach high temperatures like 70ÂºC and burn your skin. So CAUNTION.
